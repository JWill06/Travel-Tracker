# Travel Tracker 

### Abstract:
The goal of this project was to create a single page application for travelers to be able to see their past trips, pending trips, and upcoming trips. The user should also be able to input a new trip by inputting information in the form and it would display on the page after submission as 'pending'. The user can also see their total amount spent over the last three years for all trips that have been approved. The user can also see their estimated cost when looking at booking a new trip before they book it. This project was completed using javaScript, Html, and CSS.

### Learning Goals:
* To understand fetch and post request to update the local data sets
* Seperate the data model from the DOM model
* Be able to grab the appropriate information from different data sets

### Wins + Challenges:
*Wins*
  1. Being able to figure out the issues with my fetch requests.
  2. Being able to understand all of my own code written. 

*Challenges*
  1. I experienced several errors when fetching data that was all due to either returning the wrong thing our having a console log instead of a return. 
  2. When a user adds a new trip it wouldn't show properly on the dom until they logged out and back in.
